# React and Redux basic tutorial.

This is a Redux and Redux toolkit demonstration in a simple React micro web App. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run fullstack`

This runs the app in the development mode on port 3000. The page will reload when you make changes. Redux is used not only to manage state but to also fetch dummy products from the backend directory. First I implemented fetch queries with Axios, and then I commented this code out and implemented Redux slices instead, that manage state and fetch all products, and single product accordingly.
